Pandadroid is the ultimate 3d engine for the most ultimate 3d needs of a panda. Like for 3d bamboo, hence the 3d library for it is Bamboo. The goal for this entire project is to make 3d app developement for the Android easy and fast. It is not trying to compete to be the most decked out engine (though maybe one day it will just be that naturally), instead it is being fairly specific to the Android and taking advantage of the different types of input (such as touch and the accelerometer).

Bamboo is a 3d data management system that can be sent to a custom renderer to render data such as meshes, skinned meshes, lighting, camera, etc. It unfortunately is not eatable. So if you're a starving panda, you'll have to go to the store and buy canned bamboo. Bamboo itself is just concerned with data and data manipulation. It does not provide an actual way to render the scene, but it does provide functions to handle the rendering process (the order things are rendered, where items are, updating items, handling animations, etc). Pandadroid comes with an actual opengl es 1.0 renderer so if people want to make a renderer for a different platform or graphics api, they can follow the example there. Bamboo also comes with base classes for handling I/O that can be extended to different platforms.

Bamporter is a Bamboo file writer that can open COLLADA files (and maybe some more if it looks like there's a need) and then save the file components out to a Bamboo file. Bamporter will allow people to also add data that is not easily exported through COLLADA (such as animation clips) and it will allow for merging files. It is the tool to preparing data for being loaded into Bamboo.
