PandaDroid is the ultimate Android 3d engine for the most ultimate 3d needs of a panda. It runs off Bamboo.

BAMporter is a desktop Bamboo asset editor with a plug-in system for extending it into a a game editor.

Bamboo is a 3d data management system that can be sent to a custom renderer   to render data such as meshes, skinned meshes, lighting, camera, etc. It unfortunately is not eatable. So if you're a starving panda, you'll have to go to the store and buy canned bamboo.
